Findings
- High: `backend/alembic/versions/002_phase_2_video_management_schema.py:105` (`:106`, `:140`) – the migration tries to model descending indexes via `postgresql_ops={'column': 'DESC'}`. `postgresql_ops` configures operator classes, so Alembic will emit `OPERATOR CLASS "DESC"`, which Postgres rejects. Result: `alembic upgrade` for Phase 2.1 fails before finishing. Use explicit `sa.text("uploaded_at DESC")` / `column.desc()` or `postgresql_ops` with a real operator class plus `postgresql_sort`. 
- High: `backend/alembic/versions/002_phase_2_video_management_schema.py:53-68` – new `uploaded_at` column is `TIMESTAMPTZ`, but the phase 1 `upload_timestamp` source is `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`. The update statement copies the raw value, so Postgres interprets it in the server’s local TZ, then converts to UTC. If phase 1 data was stored as UTC (common because we use `datetime.utcnow()`), every migrated row will shift by the server offset (e.g., -7 h in PDT). We should either keep `uploaded_at` without TZ or cast with `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` during migration.

Open Questions / Assumptions
- Are we planning to drop the legacy `camera_pin_id` soon? Keeping both FKs is fine for now, but it would be good to know the deprecation timeline so follow‑on tasks can simplify the ORM.

Overall Impression
- Schema/table coverage is thorough, and the README is super helpful; once the migration runs cleanly and we fix the timestamp conversion, the foundation looks solid.

Re-review
- Cleared: `backend/alembic/versions/002_phase_2_video_management_schema.py:107`, `:108`, `:142` – descending indexes now use `sa.text('… DESC')`, yielding valid `CREATE INDEX ... (column DESC)` SQL. Local upgrade succeeds. 
- Cleared: `backend/alembic/versions/002_phase_2_video_management_schema.py:69` – migration now casts legacy `TIMESTAMP` fields with `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`, so UTC-stored values no longer shift during conversion.

Verification
- `alembic upgrade head` runs without errors; `pg_indexes` shows the expected DESC clauses; sample `uploaded_at - upload_timestamp` diffs return `00:00:00`.
