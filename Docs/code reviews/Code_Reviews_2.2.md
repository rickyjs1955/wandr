Findings
- High: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:193` – multipart chunks are written to `"{object_name}.part{n}"` without including the `upload_id`. If two sessions target the same final key (retries, parallel uploads, resume vs. new upload), they stomp on each other’s part objects or compose a mix of chunks, corrupting the video. Namespace the staging objects with the upload id (e.g. `.../{upload_id}/part{n}`) and pass that prefix through completion/cleanup.
- High: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:241-252` – `abort_multipart_upload` ignores `upload_id` and wipes every `"{object_name}.part*"` object. Cancelling one session will delete another active session’s chunks, causing its upload to fail. Once part keys are namespaced per upload, scope the delete to that session’s prefix.

Re-review
- High: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:193` – part objects now include the `upload_id`, but `generate_presigned_upload_url` still requires callers to pass it; the API change wasn’t applied at the call sites. Tests (`backend/app/tests/test_storage_service.py:106`, `:148`) still expect the old signature/behavior (part names without upload id), so the fix is incomplete and current code fails to run. Update the callers/tests to pass `upload_id` and assert the new namespace.
- High: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:246-253` – abort still lists prefix `f"{object_name}.part"`; the patch description promised `.{upload_id}.` but the code wasn’t updated. Aborting one session continues to nuke all sessions’ parts. Use the namespaced prefix so only that session’s chunks are removed.

Re-review 2
- Cleared: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:146`, `:198`, `:210` – multipart part names now include `upload_id` end-to-end, and callers/tests (`backend/app/tests/test_storage_service.py:96-117`, `:128-160`) were updated to pass the session id and assert the namespaced keys. Concurrent uploads no longer collide.
- Cleared: `backend/app/services/storage_service.py:248-256` – abort now lists only `"{object_name}.{upload_id}.part"` objects; unit test verifies the scoped prefix, so cancelling a session leaves other uploads intact.
