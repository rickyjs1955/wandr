Findings
- High: `backend/app/services/job_service.py:44-72` – `ProcessingJob` adds a `parameters` attribute, but the model/migration never defined a `parameters` column (only `result_data`, `error_message`). Creating a job crashes with `TypeError: 'parameters' is an invalid keyword argument`, so every upload completion fails. Add the JSONB column or remove the field.
- High: `backend/app/services/job_service.py:44-72` – same constructor passes an explicit `queued_at=datetime.utcnow()` despite the migration setting a `server_default=NOW()` with `nullable=False`. If the column stays NOT NULL, letting the DB default populate avoids clock skew; the current override isn’t fatal but signals the missing column above.
- High: `backend/app/tasks/video_tasks.py:100-108` – placeholder task writes `video.proxy_generated`, but `Video` has no such column (migration/documentation mention it, but it doesn’t exist). SQLAlchemy accepts the attribute then drops it on commit; worse, the task still marks the job “completed”, so consumers believe a proxy exists when nothing was produced. Either add the column or drop the flag until Phase 2.5.
- High: `backend/app/api/v1/videos.py:215-240` – completion endpoint treats `job_service.queue_proxy_generation()` as fire-and-forget, but the placeholder task never touches `processing_status`. Videos stay stuck in `processing_status='pending'` with no failure path, so downstream UI can’t reflect the actual proxy state. At minimum, set `video.processing_status='processing'` when queuing and let the task update on completion; with the current placeholder, it should stay pending to avoid false positives.

Re-review
- Cleared: `backend/app/services/job_service.py:44-113` – job creation no longer passes the missing `parameters` field, relies on DB defaults for `queued_at`, and marks videos `processing` when queueing.
- Cleared: `backend/app/tasks/video_tasks.py:73-141` – placeholder task drops the nonexistent `proxy_generated` write and now transitions `processing_status` to `completed` or `failed` as it updates job state.
- Cleared: `backend/app/api/v1/videos.py:200-240` – completion endpoint now benefits from the service/task updates, so videos leave `pending` once processing is enqueued and finished.
