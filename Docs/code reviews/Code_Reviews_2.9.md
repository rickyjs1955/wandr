Findings
- High: `frontend/src/components/VideoPlayer.jsx:61-69` resets the video element to the new signed URL without preserving `currentTime` or play state. When the hook refreshes the URL (every 55 minutes by default), the player jumps back to 0:00 and stops, forcing the operator to re-seek mid-session. Capture the current time/play state before swapping the source, and restore them once the new URL’s metadata loads so refreshes stay seamless.
- Medium: `frontend/src/hooks/useSignedUrl.js:50-83` starts a new countdown interval on every refresh but never clears the previous one before assigning the new handle. After the first auto-refresh, the stale interval keeps pushing `secondsUntilExpiry` to 0, so the UI shows “Expired” even though the URL was refreshed. Clear `countdownIntervalRef.current` before starting a new interval inside `fetchSignedUrl`.

Re-review
- Cleared: `VideoPlayer.jsx` now captures `currentTime`/play state before swapping the signed URL, and restores them on the next `loadedmetadata`, so auto-refreshes no longer reset playback.
- Cleared: `useSignedUrl.js` clears the existing countdown interval before starting a new one on refresh, preventing stale timers from forcing "Expired" status.
