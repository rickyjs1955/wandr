## Deployment Execution

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] **Announce maintenance window** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Create deployment tag** in git
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Production release 1.0.0"
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```
- [ ] **Backup current production state**
- [ ] **Verify rollback plan**

### Deployment Steps

- [ ] **Deploy database migrations**
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic upgrade head
  ```

- [ ] **Deploy backend application**
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build backend
  ```

- [ ] **Deploy frontend application**
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build frontend
  ```

- [ ] **Verify all services are healthy**
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
  ```

  - Test login/logout
  - Test API health endpoint
  - Test map viewer loads
  - Test video upload (small test file)

### Post-Deployment

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

- Critical bug affecting core functionality

### Rollback Steps

1. **Stop new deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   ```

2. **Checkout previous version**
   ```bash
   git checkout v0.9.0  # previous stable tag
   ```

3. **Rollback database migrations** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic downgrade <revision>
   ```

4. **Restore database backup** (if data corruption)
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres psql -U spatial_user -d spatial_intel < backup_YYYYMMDD.sql
   ```

5. **Redeploy previous version**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
   ```

6. **Verify rollback success**
